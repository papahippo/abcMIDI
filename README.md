# abcMIDI
This project was created (many years after the assosciated code was written!) in order to co-ordinate and document a quality improvement activity. The initial instigation of this activity was the large number of compiler warnings when generating abcmidi and 'friends', but it soon became apparent that a number of real defects needed to be addfressed.

All the code is currently in the abcmidi subdirectory of this project directory. You will also find a rather ou-of-date "readme" there.
